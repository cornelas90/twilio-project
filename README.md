# twilio-project
Still WIP, heroku being weird.

This project focuses on using a twilio phonenumber to automatically respond to keywords with information regarding the last FIFA worldcup.
This work will be used to springboard to a different project I plan to work on, which utilizes an NBA API instead, so to stay relevant.
Obstacles right now are getting heroku to play nice: I think the free version has a weird dynos limitation or something.
